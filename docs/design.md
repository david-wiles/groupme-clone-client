# Web Client Design

Most people today will use chat apps on their phone. Although this project would make the most sense as a mobile app, 
it will start out as a web app just to make things a bit easier. Eventually, this project may also include an expo app
target. The design described here assumes a mobile-first experience, although there will be minor changes for a 
desktop experience. 

This client is a bare-bones SPA. The main focus should be the individual chats which the user is actively participating
in. For simplicity we will only allow one chat open at a time. This chat should take up the entire screen for the best
experience. At the top of the screen should be a toolbar or hamburger button, which will open a shelf for the user
to then select other chats or to edit their profile.
